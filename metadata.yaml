    The charm can be deployed either as a validator, collator, bootnode, or RPC on any Polkadot derived blockchain, also known as parachains. The deployment config differs depending on the chain that is being deployed.

    The charm starts the Polkadot client as a service, taking startup arguments from /etc/default/polkadot and is set by the juju config *service-args*. The Polkadot client itself is downloaded and installed from the config *binary-url*.

    The charm is maintained by https://dwellir.com also offering services within blockchain and web3.
